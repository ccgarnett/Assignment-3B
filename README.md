Description
To give everyone an opportunity to practice writing JUnit 5 test cases and to discover the bugs, you will do this assignment (Assignment 3B) individually. Here is what you need to do:
Clone your assigned program, set it up, and run it.
Write JUnit 5 tests for the code. Donâ€™t forget to comment your test classes. Each class should have the author information and other javadoc and regular comments.
Discover the bugs through the tests!
Take screenshots of the failed tests. 
Fix the bugs and run the tests again.
Take screenshots of the passed tests.
Take screenshots of the coverage your tests have achieved.
Upload your code to a new github repository. 
Write down the bugs you discovered and your experience. 
Submission
Print the program and your JUnit test code into a pdf file from your IDE. Make sure you have the color annotations and indentations in the pdf file.
Append the following screenshots
Failed tests
Passed tests
The coverage your tests achieved.
Write descriptions of the bugs you discovered
A write up of your overall experience. Discuss the code coverage your tests have been able to achieve. If you took any support from any LLM, give credit clearly to the LLM you used and to what degree. 
Include the URL of your github repository where you have uploaded the bug-fixed program and its unit tests.
Put everything together on a pdf file and submit that.
